# recipe-management
The Recipe Management System is designed as a microservice-based application that allows users to manage their favorite recipes. Users can add, update, remove, and fetch recipes, as well as filter recipes based on various criteria such as vegetarian status, number of servings, specific ingredients, and text search within instructions.
